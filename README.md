# dynamic-restaurant-data

Comeup with a Json structure containing all the Data of a Restaurant including location products and all the other stuff need to show a webpage and fill it with content.
The content of the page is the actual project where the data from a cms will be used to create the webpage dynamically including sections with a map to display the location and other visually appearing ways to display the restaurant. 

Tech stack would be Nextjs, for the cms you can come up with your own solution. A local file db would be alright for the start but its all up to you.
